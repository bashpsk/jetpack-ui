 * Represents the different types of drag changes that can occur during a drag gesture.

 * - [DragStart]: Indicates the start of a drag gesture, providing the initial position.

 * - [DragCanceled]: Signals that the drag gesture was canceled.

 * - [VerticalRightChanges]: Represents vertical drag changes specifically for the right side.
 * - [TransformChanges]: Represents changes in zoom and pan during a transform gesture
 * (e.g., pinch-to-zoom).
 * - [Unknown]: Represents an unknown or unhandled drag change.
