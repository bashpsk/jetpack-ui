/**
 * Represents the different types of tap gestures that can be detected.

 *
 * Possible tap changes include:
 * - [Unknown]: Represents an unrecognized or indeterminate tap state.
 * - [SingleTap]: Represents a standard single tap gesture.
 * - [ForwardTap]: Represents a tap gesture that is typically interpreted as a "forward" action,
 *   often associated with tapping on the right side of a view.
 * - [BackwardTap]: Represents a tap gesture that is typically interpreted as a "backward" action,
 *   often associated with tapping on the left side of a view.
